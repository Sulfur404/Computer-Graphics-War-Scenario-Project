# 🚀 Computer Graphics War Scenario Project

This project is an animated 2D war simulation created using **C++ and OpenGL (GLUT)**. It renders a battlefield filled with **tanks**, **fighter planes**, **explosions**, **burning buildings**, **metro trains**, and **damaged infrastructure** — all dynamically animated to simulate an intense war environment.
